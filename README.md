For this excersise i chose to work with Bootstrap. The initial reason was that i had heard about it before  and thought it was the go-to framework to work with.
It was difficult to find the little details on how to make the layout react like the picture on our assignment.
it was also difficult to make the navbar dissapear completely. I was in doubt if the assigntment ment to use a toggle button ot make it completely dissapear.
The positive about working with Bootstrap would be the easyness to make a page responsive.
