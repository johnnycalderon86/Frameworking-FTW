For this excersise i chose to work with Bootstrap. The initial reason was that i had heard about it before  and thought it was the go-to framework to work with.<br>
It was difficult to find the little details on how to make the layout react like the picture on our assignment.<br>
it was also difficult to make the navbar dissapear completely. I was in doubt if the assigntment ment to use a toggle button ot make it completely dissapear.<br>
The positive about working with Bootstrap would be the easyness to make a page responsive.
